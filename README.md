# üçî Food App

This is a **Food Ordering Website** built with modern frontend tools like **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Redux Toolkit**. It is a personal practice project to improve my full-stack skills. The design and layout are inspired by a construction site UI I previously created ‚Äî now re-themed for food services.

In the future, I will add a **Node.js backend** to make the site fully dynamic and enable features like cart handling, orders, and user accounts.
